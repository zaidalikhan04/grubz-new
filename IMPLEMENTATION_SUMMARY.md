# User Flow Implementation Summary

## üéØ **Project Requirements Implemented**

### ‚úÖ **1. User Sign Up & Login Flow**
- **Auto-login after signup**: Users are automatically logged in after successful registration
- **Basic info storage**: User data (name, email, phone) is stored in `users/{uid}` upon signup
- **Default role**: All users sign up as 'customer' by default

### ‚úÖ **2. Profile Sync**
- **Real-time sync**: Profile data is fetched and synced in real-time using `onSnapshot()`
- **Auto-population**: Profile section displays data from `users/{uid}` collection
- **Editable fields**: Missing fields (phone, address) appear blank and are editable

### ‚úÖ **3. Role Application (Restaurant / Driver)**
- **Post-login applications**: Users can only apply for partner roles after logging in
- **Correct collections**: Applications are saved to:
  - `restaurantApplications/{uid}` for restaurant applications
  - `deliveryApplications/{uid}` for delivery applications

### ‚úÖ **4. Admin Approval & Role Upgrade**
- **Role update**: Admin approval updates user's role in `users/{uid}`
- **Data migration**: Approved application data is moved to:
  - `restaurants/{uid}` for restaurant owners
  - `drivers/{uid}` for delivery drivers

### ‚úÖ **5. My Restaurant / Driver Section**
- **Real-time display**: Data is fetched from appropriate collections using `onSnapshot()`
- **Immediate visibility**: Changes are visible immediately after approval

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ restaurants/{uid}             // Approved restaurant data
