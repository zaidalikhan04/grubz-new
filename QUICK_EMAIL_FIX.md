# 🚨 QUICK EMAIL FIX - Why You're Not Receiving Emails

## The Problem
Your EmailJS is sending successfully (Status: OK) but emails aren't being received. Here are the **most likely causes**:

## 🎯 **SOLUTION 1: Check Your Spam Folder (90% of cases)**

### Gmail Users:
1. **Check "Spam" folder** - Click "More" in left sidebar → "Spam"
2. **Check "Promotions" tab** - Look for emails in the Promotions tab
3. **Search for emails** - Search "grubz" or "emailjs" in Gmail search
4. **Check "All Mail"** - Sometimes emails get filtered

### Outlook Users:
1. **Check "Junk Email" folder**
2. **Check "Clutter" folder** (if enabled)
3. **Search for "grubz"** in search box

## 🎯 **SOLUTION 2: EmailJS Template Issue**

Your EmailJS template might not be configured correctly. Here's what to check:

### Go to EmailJS Dashboard:
1. Visit https://www.emailjs.com/
2. Go to "Email Templates"
3. Find your template (probably called "Welcome" or similar)

### Your template should look like this:
```
Subject: {{subject}}

Dear {{to_name}},

{{message}}

Best regards,
{{from_name}}
```

### Common Template Issues:
- ❌ Missing `{{to_email}}` in the "To" field
- ❌ Wrong variable names (should match exactly)
- ❌ Template not published/active

## 🎯 **SOLUTION 3: Environment Variables**

Your app is looking for these environment variables:
- `VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID`
- `VITE_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID` 
- `VITE_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY`

### Check if they're set:
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Type: `console.log(import.meta.env)`
3. Look for your EmailJS variables

### If missing, create `.env` file:
```
VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=service_xxxxxxx
VITE_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=template_xxxxxxx
VITE_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key_here
```

## 🎯 **SOLUTION 4: Gmail Security Settings**

If using Gmail as your email service in EmailJS:

### Option A: App Password (Recommended)
1. Enable 2-Factor Authentication on Gmail
2. Go to Google Account → Security → 2-Step Verification → App passwords
3. Generate app password for "Mail"
4. Use this password in EmailJS (not your regular password)

### Option B: Less Secure Apps (Temporary)
1. Go to Google Account → Security
2. Turn ON "Less secure app access"
3. Note: Google is phasing this out

## 🎯 **IMMEDIATE TEST STEPS**

### Step 1: Check Spam Folders
- **Do this first!** 90% of email delivery issues are spam filtering

### Step 2: Test with Different Email
- Try sending to a different email provider (Yahoo, Outlook, etc.)
- Use a personal email vs work email

### Step 3: Use the Email Tester
- Go to Admin Dashboard → "Email Tester"
- Enter your email and click "Send Test Email"
- Check console for any error messages

### Step 4: Verify EmailJS Setup
1. Go to https://www.emailjs.com/
2. Check "Email Services" - make sure your service is connected
3. Check "Email Templates" - verify template exists and is active
4. Check "Email History" - see if emails are being processed

## 🔧 **Quick Debug Commands**

Open browser console (F12) and run:

```javascript
// Check if EmailJS is loaded
console.log('EmailJS loaded:', typeof emailjs !== 'undefined');

// Check environment variables
console.log('Environment:', import.meta.env);

// Test EmailJS directly
emailjs.send('your_service_id', 'your_template_id', {
  to_email: 'your-email@gmail.com',
  to_name: 'Test User',
  subject: 'Direct Test',
  message: 'This is a direct EmailJS test'
}).then(console.log).catch(console.error);
```

## 📧 **Most Common EmailJS Template Format**

Make sure your EmailJS template looks exactly like this:

**To:** {{to_email}}
**Subject:** {{subject}}
**Content:**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
  <h2>{{subject}}</h2>
  <p>Dear {{to_name}},</p>
  <div>{{message}}</div>
  <p>Best regards,<br>{{from_name}}</p>
</body>
</html>
```
